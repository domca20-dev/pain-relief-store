        <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
        <p>A few years ago, someone very close to our founder was living with chronic lower back pain. Not the kind that comes and goes — the kind that steals your life in small pieces. Skipping family walks. Cancelling plans. Lying awake at 3am staring at the ceiling because no position is comfortable.</p>
        <p>They tried everything. Prescription painkillers that left them foggy. Over-the-counter creams that barely scratched the surface. A TENS unit that buzzed and tingled but changed nothing. Physical therapy helped a little — but the relief never lasted past the car ride home.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just the pain. It was the look in their eyes — that quiet resignation, like they'd accepted this was just their life now. That look haunted our founder. And it lit a fire.</p>

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2>Going Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>Our founder spent months researching — not marketing, not product labels — but peer-reviewed clinical studies. Published research from institutions around the world. The question was simple: <strong>why does chronic pain persist even when people are doing "everything right"?</strong></p>
        <p>The answer turned out to be a depth problem. Most pain relief products — creams, patches, heating pads, TENS units — work within the top 1–3mm of tissue. But chronic pain from conditions like sciatica, arthritis, herniated discs, and degenerative joint disease originates 5–8mm below the surface. These products weren't failing because they were bad. They were failing because they couldn't reach the problem.</p>
        <p>Then came the breakthrough: <strong>photobiomodulation</strong>. Infrared light at specific wavelengths (660nm red and 850nm near-infrared) had been clinically shown to penetrate to 8mm depth, reduce inflammatory markers like TNF-α and IL-6, and boost cellular energy production (ATP) at the source. It wasn't new — it had decades of clinical research behind it. But it wasn't accessible. Clinical devices cost thousands. Consumer products were either underpowered or poorly designed.</p>

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2>Building Something That Actually Works</h2>
        <p>We set out to build a wearable device that delivered clinical-grade infrared light therapy in a form factor real people would actually use. Not a bulky panel you strap to a table. Not a flimsy wrap with three weak LEDs. Something you could wear while making dinner, watching TV, or sitting at your desk.</p>
        <p>It took over a year of prototyping, testing, and refinement. We obsessed over wavelength accuracy, LED density, battery life, comfort, and fit. We tested it with real people — not lab subjects, but parents, grandparents, workers, and athletes living with chronic pain every single day.</p>
        <p>The feedback changed everything. People who hadn't slept through the night in years were sleeping again. People who'd stopped walking their dogs started going on morning walks. People who'd accepted pain as permanent started believing it didn't have to be.</p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <div class="about-values">
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>Pain relief shouldn't come with side effects</h3>
            <p>No chemicals. No drugs. No dependency. Infrared light therapy is non-invasive with zero known serious side effects at therapeutic wavelengths.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>You deserve to try it risk-free</h3>
            <p>We offer a 60-day money-back guarantee because we believe in the science and we believe in this product. If it doesn't work for you, you get every penny back.</p>

          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>Real people, real support</h3>
            <p>When you email us, a real person answers. We've been where you are — watching pain take things from someone we love. We treat every customer the way we'd want to be treated.</p>

          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>Science over marketing</h3>
            <p>We don't make miracle claims. We point to published research, explain the mechanism, and let you decide. The science speaks for itself.</p>

        <h2>Who We're Really For</h2>
        <p>We built [BRAND] for the person who's tired of temporary fixes. The person who's been told to "just manage it." The person lying awake tonight wondering if this is just their life now.</p>
        <p>It doesn't have to be. And we built this company to prove it.</p>
