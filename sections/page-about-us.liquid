        <p class="about-lead">This company wasn't born in a boardroom. It was born at a kitchen table — watching someone we love try to unload a dishwasher and have to stop halfway through because the pain turned her vision white.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
        <p>She used to be the person everyone called when something needed doing. She organized the church food drive for twelve years straight. She cooked Sunday dinners for the whole family — pot roast, three sides, homemade rolls. She ran a half-marathon at 42.</p>
        <p>Then chronic lower back pain took all of it. Not overnight. Piece by piece. First the walks stopped. Then the cooking. Then the plans she'd cancel until people stopped inviting her. Her world shrank to her recliner and a heating pad that stopped helping around 2 AM.</p>
        <p>She had a drawer in her nightstand — stuffed with products she'd bought late at night when the pain wouldn't let her sleep. TENS units. Copper wraps. Creams. A vibrating cushion. Eight products, maybe $500. Every one was "this is the one." Every one ended up in that drawer.</p>
        <p>The pills left her foggy. The cortisone shots lasted shorter each time — eight weeks, then three, then barely ten days. Her doctor told her to "manage her expectations." She just wanted to sit through her granddaughter's dance recital without leaving early.</p>
        <p>But the worst part wasn't the pain. It was the look in her eyes — that quiet resignation, like she'd accepted this was just her life now. She once told us: "I'm not me anymore." That sentence broke something in our founder. And it lit a fire.</p>

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2>The 2 AM Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>Our founder started where she did — at 2 AM, searching for answers. But instead of product pages and Facebook ads, they went deeper. Peer-reviewed clinical studies. Published research. The question was simple: <strong>why does everything fail? Why does nothing last?</strong></p>
        <p>The answer turned out to be something nobody was talking about. Every cream, heating pad, TENS unit, and patch in that drawer worked within the top 1–3mm of tissue. But chronic pain from conditions like sciatica, arthritis, and herniated discs originates 5–8mm below the surface. Those products weren't bad. They just couldn't reach where the pain actually lived. She hadn't tried "everything." She'd tried one depth eleven times in different packaging.</p>
        <p>Then came the discovery that changed everything: <strong>infrared light therapy</strong>. Specific wavelengths — 660nm and 850nm — had been clinically shown to penetrate 8mm into tissue, reduce inflammation at the source, and restore the cellular energy that damaged tissue needs to repair itself. Physical therapy clinics had been using it for 30 years — behind machines costing $5,000–$50,000 and sessions at $200 each. The technology existed. It just wasn't accessible to the people who needed it most.</p>

        <h2>Building Something for the Drawer People</h2>
        <p>We built this for everyone with a drawer. Everyone who's spent thousands on promises that lasted a week. Everyone who lies awake at 3 AM wondering if this is just their life now.</p>
        <p>We set out to put clinical-grade infrared therapy into something a real person would actually use — not a bulky panel, not a flimsy wrap with three weak LEDs. Something you could wear while making dinner, sitting with your grandkids, or watching TV in your recliner.</p>
        <p>We tested it with real people living with real pain. Not lab subjects — grandparents, retirees, workers, people who'd been told to "manage expectations" by doctors who'd run out of answers. People who said "I've tried everything" and meant it.</p>
        <p>The stories that came back stopped us in our tracks. A woman who cooked Sunday dinner for her family for the first time in two years. A grandfather who got down on the floor and played with his granddaughter. A retired carpenter who went back into his workshop. People who'd been living from their recliner to their bed started getting their lives back — not all at once, but piece by piece. The same way pain took it.</p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <div class="about-values">
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>You shouldn't have to trade pain for fog</h3>
            <p>No chemicals. No drugs. No waking up feeling like a zombie. We watched someone we love hate herself for relying on pills that made her feel "like a junkie." Pain relief shouldn't come with shame.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>You've earned the right to be skeptical</h3>
            <p>After everything you've spent, everything that's failed — we don't blame you. That's why we give you 60 full days and your money back if we're wrong. No questions. No hoops. No guilt.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>Real people who actually understand</h3>
            <p>When you email us, a real person answers — someone who's watched chronic pain steal from someone they love. We don't read from scripts. We've been in that kitchen. We've seen that look.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-value">
            <h3>Explanations, not promises</h3>
            <p>We don't say "miracle cure." We don't say "pain-free in 5 minutes." We explain why everything else failed, show you the research, and let you decide. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This isn't that. This is science that's been hidden behind a price wall for 30 years.</p>

        <h2>Who We're Really For</h2>
        <p>We built [BRAND] for the person who keeps a drawer full of broken promises. The person who's been told to "manage your expectations." The person who used to be the one everyone counted on — and now feels like a burden.</p>
        <p>The person lying awake at 2 AM, scrolling through their phone, looking for something — anything — that might actually be different.</p>
        <p>You're still in there. Your body just hasn't been reached.</p>
