  Section 7: "The Science" — mechanism explanation
  660nm + 850nm, ATP, photobiomodulation. Clinical credibility.
  Keep it accessible — our demo is 45-70 year olds, not scientists.

      Physical therapy clinics have used this technology for 30+ years — behind machines costing $5,000–$50,000 and sessions at $200 each. Here's what it does that nothing in your drawer can.

          When both wavelengths work together, <strong>your cells get the energy they've been missing</strong> —
          like plugging in a dead phone. The phone isn't broken. The battery ran out.
          Inflammation decreases. Pain signals reduce. The cycle that kept you hurting finally breaks.
