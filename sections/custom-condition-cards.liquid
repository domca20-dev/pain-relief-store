        <h3 class="condition-card__title">Back Pain</h3>
        <p class="condition-card__desc">
          Chronic back pain often stems from deep-tissue inflammation compressing nerves between vertebrae.
          Surface treatments can't reach it. The [BRAND]™ belt delivers 660nm + 850nm infrared light
          <strong>8mm deep</strong> — directly to the inflamed tissue, reducing swelling and restoring mobility
          without pills or injections.

        <h3 class="condition-card__title">Sciatica</h3>
        <p class="condition-card__desc">
          Sciatic nerve pain radiates because inflammation deep in the lumbar region compresses the nerve root.
          The belt's near-infrared wavelength penetrates to the compression point, <strong>reducing the
          inflammatory markers</strong> (TNF-α, IL-6) that irritate the nerve — addressing the cause, not
          masking the signal.

        <h3 class="condition-card__title">Arthritis & Joint Pain</h3>
        <p class="condition-card__desc">
          Joint pain from arthritis is driven by chronic inflammation inside the joint capsule — far
          deeper than any cream or patch can reach. Infrared therapy at 850nm <strong>increases blood flow
          and ATP production</strong> in the joint tissue, helping cells repair and reducing the stiffness
          that makes mornings unbearable.

        <h3 class="condition-card__title">Muscle Strains</h3>
        <p class="condition-card__desc">
          Strained muscles heal slowly because damaged fibers sit deep beneath the skin where blood flow is limited.
          The dual-wavelength light <strong>boosts circulation and cellular energy</strong> at the injury site,
          accelerating the body's natural repair process — so you recover in days, not weeks.

          Clinics have used these exact wavelengths for 30+ years to speed post-surgical healing.
          Infrared light <strong>reduces inflammation around surgical sites</strong> and stimulates
          collagen production — supporting recovery without additional medication.

          When inflammation persists, tissue becomes rigid and range of motion shrinks.
          The [BRAND]™ belt delivers infrared energy that <strong>relaxes deep tissue and improves
          flexibility</strong> — so you can bend, reach, and move like you used to. 92% of users
          reported improved mobility within weeks.
