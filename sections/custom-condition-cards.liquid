          "Every morning I negotiate with my body about what I can and can't do today."
          If that sounds familiar, it's because chronic back pain runs deep — inflammation compressing nerves between vertebrae,
          far below where any cream or heating pad can reach. The [BRAND]™ belt delivers infrared light
          <strong>8mm deep</strong> — directly to the source, reducing the inflammation that makes getting out of bed
          a 90-second ordeal.

          That electric pain that shoots down your leg — the one that made one customer say "it feels like someone
          drove a hot spike through my spine" — happens because inflammation deep in the lumbar region compresses the nerve root.
          The belt's near-infrared wavelength penetrates to the compression point, <strong>reducing the
          inflammatory markers</strong> that irritate the nerve. Not masking it. Reaching it.

          "The simplest tasks feel like climbing a mountain." Arthritis is driven by inflammation
          inside the joint capsule — far deeper than any cream or patch can reach. Infrared therapy at 850nm
          <strong>increases blood flow and cellular energy</strong> in the joint tissue, helping reduce the stiffness
          that makes mornings unbearable and simple tasks feel impossible.

          Strained muscles heal slowly because damaged fibers sit deep beneath the skin where blood flow is limited.
          The dual-wavelength light <strong>boosts circulation and cellular energy</strong> at the injury site,
          helping your body's own repair process do what it's been trying to do — it just hasn't been reached.

          Whether you're recovering from a procedure or trying to avoid one, clinics have used these exact wavelengths
          for 30+ years to <strong>reduce inflammation around surgical sites</strong> and support healing —
          without adding another prescription to the pile.

          When inflammation persists, tissue becomes rigid and your world shrinks to your bedroom and your couch.
          The [BRAND]™ belt delivers infrared energy that <strong>relaxes deep tissue and restores
          flexibility</strong> — so you can bend, reach, and start moving like the person you used to be.
