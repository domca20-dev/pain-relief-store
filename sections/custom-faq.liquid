        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Most users report noticing a difference within the first 1–2 weeks of daily use. Some feel a deep, soothing warmth from the very first session that's noticeably different from a heating pad — because the infrared light is actually reaching deeper tissue. The most significant changes (reduced flare-ups, improved mobility, better sleep) typically develop over 2–4 weeks of consistent use. Everyone's body is different, which is why we offer a full 60-day guarantee — enough time to experience real results.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Will it help with sciatica / arthritis / herniated disc?</span>

        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>The [BRAND]™ belt is used by people with all three conditions — and many others. The underlying mechanism is the same: chronic inflammation deep in tissue that surface treatments can't reach. Our 660nm + 850nm wavelengths penetrate 8mm to the tissue depth where inflammation from sciatica, arthritis, and disc issues originates. We can't promise it'll cure any condition, but 88% of our users report significant pain reduction, and we've heard from hundreds of people with these specific issues who've found meaningful relief.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Is it comfortable? Can I move normally while wearing it?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Yes. The belt is lightweight, flexible, and designed to be worn during daily activities. Cook dinner, watch TV, read, work at your desk, or even do light chores. The adjustable strap fits waists 28"–48" and stays secure without pinching or sliding. Most users say they forget they're wearing it after the first few minutes. You'll feel a gentle warmth — not hot, not uncomfortable — just enough to know it's working.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Does it actually fix the problem or just mask pain?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>This is the most important difference. Pills, creams, and TENS units mask the pain signal — turn off the alarm without putting out the fire. The [BRAND]™ belt works differently: infrared light at 660nm and 850nm triggers <strong>photobiomodulation</strong>, which reduces inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-6) and increases cellular energy (ATP) at the source of pain. It addresses the inflammation driving your pain, not just the sensation of it. That's why results tend to build over time rather than disappear when you stop using it.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>I've tried everything. Will this really be different?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>We hear this every day — and we understand the skepticism. Here's the honest truth: if you've tried heating pads, creams, patches, and TENS units, you've tried products that all operate in the same 1–3mm depth range. Your pain lives 5–8mm deep. You haven't tried "everything" — you've tried one depth in different packaging. The [BRAND]™ belt is the first thing most of our customers try that actually reaches where chronic pain originates. That's not marketing — it's physics. And with our 60-day guarantee, you risk nothing by finding out for yourself.</p>

        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>The belt comes with a USB-C charging cable and holds enough charge for multiple 30-minute sessions. A full charge takes approximately 2 hours. No disposable batteries, no cords tethering you to a wall outlet. Charge it, wear it, go about your day.</p>

        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>The [BRAND]™ belt features an adjustable strap that fits waists 28"–48". The wrap design means it conforms to your body shape rather than requiring a specific size. It works equally well on the lower back, hip, knee, or shoulder. If you're between sizes or have concerns about fit, reach out to our support team — we're happy to help before you order.</p>

          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>We recommend 20–30 minute sessions, 1–2 times per day. The belt has an auto-shutoff timer so you don't need to watch the clock. Many users do a morning session and an evening session. Some use it while sleeping. There's no risk of overuse — infrared light therapy is non-invasive with no known side effects at these wavelengths and durations.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Is infrared light therapy safe?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Yes. Infrared light therapy (photobiomodulation) has been used clinically for over 30 years with an excellent safety profile. The wavelengths used (660nm and 850nm) are non-ionizing, meaning they don't damage cells like UV light. There are no known serious side effects. That said, we always recommend consulting your healthcare provider before starting any new therapy, especially if you're pregnant, have a pacemaker, or are being treated for cancer.</p>
