        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>We'll be straight with you — this isn't a "miracle cure in 5 minutes" situation. If someone tells you that, run. Most people notice a difference within 1–2 weeks of daily use. Not a heating-pad-warm-fuzzy feeling that disappears when you take it off — something different. Deeper. The bigger changes — fewer flare-ups, better mornings, actually sleeping through the night — tend to build over 2–4 weeks. We give you 60 full days because we know you've been disappointed before, and we want you to have enough time to know this is real.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Will it help with sciatica / arthritis / herniated disc?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Yes — because the underlying problem is the same: chronic inflammation deep in tissue that nothing you've tried has been able to reach. Whether it's sciatica shooting down your leg, arthritis making your mornings unbearable, or a herniated disc that makes bending down feel like a gamble — the inflammation sits 5–8mm deep, and that's exactly where our 660nm + 850nm wavelengths reach. We won't promise you a cure. But 88% of our customers report meaningful pain reduction, and many of them came to us after trying everything — the pills, the shots, the drawer full of gadgets that stopped working after a week.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Is it comfortable? Can I move normally while wearing it?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Yes. We designed it for people who are already dealing with enough. You shouldn't have to strap into some bulky contraption just to get relief. The belt is lightweight, flexible, and fits waists 28"–48". Wear it while you cook dinner, watch TV, sit with your grandkids, or read in your recliner. Most people forget it's on after a few minutes. You'll feel a gentle warmth — not the surface heat of a heating pad, but something settling deeper. That's the infrared reaching tissue nothing else could.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Does it actually fix the problem or just mask pain?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>This is the question that matters. Here's the honest answer: pills block the pain signal. TENS units distract your nerves for twenty minutes. Heating pads warm your skin. All of them are turning off the smoke alarm while the fire keeps burning. The [BRAND]™ belt works at a different level — infrared light at 660nm and 850nm reaches the deep tissue where inflammation lives and triggers your cells' own repair process. It reduces the inflammation driving your pain, not just the feeling of it. That's why the results tend to build over time instead of vanishing the second you stop.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>I've tried everything. Will this really be different?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>We know. We hear from people every day who say exactly that — and every one of them means it. You've spent hundreds, maybe thousands. You've got the drawer to prove it. But here's what nobody told you: every heating pad, cream, patch, and TENS unit you tried works in the same 1–3mm depth range. Your pain lives 5–8mm deep. You haven't tried everything. You've tried one depth eleven times in different packaging. The [BRAND]™ belt is the first thing most of our customers try that actually reaches where the pain lives. We know that's hard to believe. That's why we give you 60 days to find out — and your money back if we're wrong.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Is the belt rechargeable? How is it powered?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>The belt comes with a USB-C charging cable and holds enough charge for multiple 30-minute sessions. A full charge takes approximately 2 hours. No disposable batteries, no cords tethering you to a wall outlet. Charge it, wear it, go about your day.</p>

          <span>What size fits me?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>The [BRAND]™ belt features an adjustable strap that fits waists 28"–48". The wrap design means it conforms to your body shape rather than requiring a specific size. It works equally well on the lower back, hip, knee, or shoulder. If you're between sizes or have concerns about fit, reach out to our support team — we're happy to help before you order.</p>

          <span>How long should I use it per session?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>We recommend 20–30 minute sessions, 1–2 times per day. The belt has an auto-shutoff timer so you don't need to watch the clock. Many users do a morning session and an evening session. Some use it while sleeping. There's no risk of overuse — infrared light therapy is non-invasive with no known side effects at these wavelengths and durations.</p>

          <p>Yes. We offer free worldwide shipping on every order. Standard delivery is 5–9 business days to most countries (US, Australia, UK, Canada, EU).

          <p>60 days. Full money back. No questions. No "customer retention" phone calls. No guilt. Email support@[brand].com, we send a prepaid label, and you get your refund within 5–7 business days. We've heard from too many people who've been burned by companies that make returning something harder than buying it. That's not us. We stand behind this because the science does — and because we've watched it change lives. But if it doesn't change yours, you get every penny back.</p>

        <summary class="faq-item__question">
          <span>Is infrared light therapy safe?</span>
          <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-item__answer">
          <p>Yes. Infrared light therapy (photobiomodulation) has been used clinically for over 30 years with an excellent safety profile. The wavelengths used (660nm and 850nm) are non-ionizing, meaning they don't damage cells like UV light. There are no known serious side effects. That said, we always recommend consulting your healthcare provider before starting any new therapy, especially if you're pregnant, have a pacemaker, or are being treated for cancer.</p>
