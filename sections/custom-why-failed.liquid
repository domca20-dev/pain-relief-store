        Every cream, heating pad, TENS unit, and patch you've bought — maybe some at 2 AM when the pain wouldn't let you sleep — shares the same hidden limitation.
        They all work at the surface. Your pain doesn't live at the surface.

        You weren't crazy. You weren't picking wrong. <strong>The products had a ceiling — and your pain lives below it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="reframe-text reframe-text--solution">
        The [BRAND]™ Infrared Belt uses <strong>660nm + 850nm dual wavelengths</strong> that penetrate
        <strong>8mm into tissue</strong> — past the skin, past the surface, directly into the deep muscle and joint layer
        where inflammation builds and nerves get compressed. It doesn't mask the signal. It reaches the source.
      </p>
      <p class="reframe-text reframe-text--analogy">
        Think of it like watering a plant by misting the leaves vs. soaking the roots.
        Everything in your drawer was misting. This reaches the roots — at home, on your schedule.
