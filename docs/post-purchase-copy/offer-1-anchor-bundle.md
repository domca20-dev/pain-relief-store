You just made a decision most people put off for months. Maybe years.

You chose to stop managing pain and actually address it.

Here's what we've learned from thousands of customers who started exactly where you are right now:

**The belt works.** You'll feel it within the first week — less stiffness in the morning, fewer "bad days," more hours where you forget the pain is even there.

But pain doesn't live in just one place.

It migrates. It compensates. Your lower back tightens, so your neck picks up the slack. Your neck locks up, so your hips shift to absorb the load. One problem becomes three.

That's why our most successful customers — the ones writing us emails about getting back on the floor with their grandkids — they don't just treat one area.

**They treat the whole chain.**

## Bundle Breakdown

**The Complete Recovery System includes:**

- ✅ **Infrared Therapy Belt** *(already in your order)*
- ✅ **Neck Therapy Device** — Same dual-wavelength technology, shaped to reach the cervical spine and upper trapezius where tension headaches and referred pain originate
- ✅ **Therapeutic Cushion** — Pressure-redistribution support for sitting, driving, and sleeping — so you're not undoing progress every time you sit down

**Retail value: $299**

This price isn't on our website. It won't be in a follow-up email. It exists right here, right now, because **we can only include this in your current shipment.**

## Testimonial

> *"I bought the belt first. Loved it. Came back two weeks later for the neck device and the cushion — paid full price for both. Wish I'd grabbed the bundle from the start. The difference between treating my back alone versus treating everything together was night and day. I went from 'better' to 'I actually forgot about my pain today.' That hasn't happened in six years."*
