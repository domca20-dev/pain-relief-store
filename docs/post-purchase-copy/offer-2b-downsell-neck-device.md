## Headline

### Totally fair. How about just the neck piece?

---

## Body Copy

The full system isn't for everyone — we get it.

But here's something worth knowing before your order ships:

**Most back pain doesn't stay in the back.**

It creeps upward. Into the neck. Into the shoulders. Into headaches you don't even connect to your spine anymore. That's not a guess — it's the number one thing our customers tell us after their first month with the belt.

*"My back feels great. But now I'm noticing how tight my neck has been this whole time."*

Sound familiar? It will.

The **Neck Therapy Device** uses the same 660nm + 850nm dual wavelengths as your belt. Same depth. Same cellular repair mechanism. Just shaped to wrap the cervical spine and upper traps — the area most people don't realize is compensating for their lower back.
