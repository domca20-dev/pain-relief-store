# **PHASE 0: The Mindset Shift**

## **Stop Hunting Products. Start Mastering Direct Response.**

| "People do not buy products. They buy outcomes. They want to know: what will this do for me?" — Ben Fashani |
| :---- |

The \#1 mistake beginners make is treating ecom like product arbitrage: find a trending item on CaliData, rip a competitor’s ad, run it, pray it works. This leads to a repeating cycle of short-lived pump-and-dumps where ads fatigue within days and margins evaporate.

The shift that separates $1K months from $100K months is understanding one thing: all of ecom is ads. Your product matters, but it’s the vehicle. Your ad — the message, the psychology, the mechanism — is the engine.

Direct response marketing means every ad has one job: get someone to take a specific action RIGHT NOW. Not brand awareness. Not vibes. A click, an add-to-cart, a purchase. Every word, every image, every frame exists for that singular purpose.

### **The Three Pillars of Scaled Ecom Brands**

Every brand that sustains $10K+ days shares three things:

* **1\. Validated Market:** The demand already exists. They didn’t create it. Coffee is the most consumed drink after water. Men want higher testosterone. People want clear skin. The market was there before the product.

* **2\. Subscription/Replenishment Revenue:** Not mandatory, but dramatically easier to win with. Consumables, refills, monthly deliveries. This is what creates lifetime value and lets you afford higher acquisition costs.

* **3\. Volume of Ads:** They make a massive quantity of creatives. Not 3 ads. 30\. 50\. 100\. Each one tests a different angle, hook, or concept. Winners emerge from volume, not guessing.

| BEN’S KEY INSIGHT: "Learning means failing. The more I fail, the faster I learn. This is the guaranteed — not the quick — way to make millions. It’s just to continue failing, making creatives, and learn from that." |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 1: Market Validation**

## **Find the Money Before the Product**

There are two paths to finding a winning product. Both are valid, but both MUST include market validation.

### **Path A: Market-First (Recommended)**

Validate the market exists and is profitable, THEN find a product that fits.

1. **Step 1:** Pick a broad desire category (Health, Wealth, Relationships, Beauty, Comfort, Performance)

2. **Step 2:** Find active communities discussing problems within that category (Reddit, Facebook groups, YouTube comments, Amazon reviews, forums)

3. **Step 3:** Confirm people are actively spending money on solutions (check Facebook Ad Library for scaled competitors, check Amazon bestsellers, check SimilarWeb traffic)

4. **Step 4:** Find a product from the existing solutions those communities already use

### **Path B: Product-First**

Find a product on AliExpress, Ad Library spy tools, or competitor research, THEN validate the market.

1. **Step 1:** Find a product that’s already selling (Ad Library, competitor stores, spy tools)

2. **Step 2:** Check traffic with SimilarWeb — are they getting 100K+ monthly visits?

3. **Step 3:** Validate the underlying desire: Is this a permanent desire (health, wealth, relationships) or a trending one?

4. **Step 4:** Confirm via Reddit/forums that real people have this problem and are actively looking for solutions

### **Desire Strength Validation**

| Desire Strength \= Intensity × Scope. The stronger the desire, the easier it is to sell, the more you can charge, the faster people buy, and the more you can spend on ads. |
| :---- |

Use the Desire Strength Matrix from your Market Desires framework:

| Desire Type | Intensity | Scope | Verdict |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "I want toned calves" | Low | Narrow | AVOID — too specific |
| "I want to lose 20lbs for summer" | High | Mass | STRONG — target this |
| "I want clear skin for my wedding" | Very High | Broad | STRONG — time-bound urgency |
| "I want to stop back pain to sleep" | Severe | Huge | EXCELLENT — daily suffering \+ mass market |
| "I want to organize my pencil drawer" | Low | Narrow | AVOID — no one cares enough to pay |

| WILLIE SUTTON RULE (via Ben): "Why do you rob banks? Because that’s where the money is." Pick markets where people are already spending. Don’t try to create demand. Channel existing demand onto your product. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 2: Market Research — The Deep Dive**

## **This Is Where 90% of Your Ad Copy Comes From**

| "Copy is not written, it is assembled." — Eugene Schwartz, Breakthrough Advertising |
| :---- |

Market research is not optional. It IS the ad. Every hook, every headline, every emotional trigger in your ad comes directly from what real people are saying in forums, reviews, and comment sections. You are copying their internal dialogue so well that they have no choice but to engage.

### **What You’re Looking For**

| Research Element | What It Is | Where to Find It | How It’s Used |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Desires | "I want..." statements | Reddit, Amazon reviews, forums | Determines your ad’s PROMISE |
| Pain Points | Daily frustrations and struggles | Forum rants, YouTube comments | Creates emotional stakes in ad |
| Emotional Triggers | Fear, shame, frustration, hope | Long personal threads, confessions | Drives the hook and lead |
| Existing Solutions | What they’ve already tried | Reviews, forum discussions | Debunk section of your ad |
| Existing Beliefs | What they hold as true | Community consensus, FAQ threads | Must not violate — shift gradually |
| Language & Slang | Their exact words and terms | Throughout all sources | Mirror in ad copy for resonance |
| Root Causes | Deepest reason the problem exists | Medical threads, expert content | Your UMP (Unique Mechanism Problem) |
| Gold Stories | Long, emotional personal accounts | Reddit confessions, reviews | Story framework for ads |

### **Research Sources (Ranked by Value)**

* **Reddit:** Search "\[your problem\] reddit" — raw, unfiltered emotional language. Look for threads with 50+ comments.

* **Amazon Reviews (1-3 star):** Competitors’ negative reviews reveal exactly what’s wrong with existing solutions.

* **Facebook Groups:** Join 3-5 groups in your niche. Lurk. Screenshot the language people use.

* **YouTube Comments:** Under competitor product reviews — people reveal desires and objections freely.

* **TrustPilot/Review Sites:** Cross-reference with Amazon for recurring themes.

* **Customer Support Tickets:** If you have access to a competitor’s complaints (or your own later), this is gold.

### **The Three Advertising Fundamentals**

Before writing a single word of copy, you must understand where your market sits on three dimensions. These determine EVERYTHING about how your ad is structured.

| 1\. DESIRE — What do they want? (The “I want” statement) 2\. AWARENESS — How much do they already know? (5 stages) 3\. SOPHISTICATION — How much have they already seen? (5 stages) |
| :---- |

## **The 5 Stages of Awareness (Schwartz / Ecomelite)**

Awareness determines HOW you open your ad — how directly you can mention the problem, solution, or product.

| Stage | What They Know | % of Market | Your Ad Opens With... |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1\. Unaware | Don’t know they have a problem | \~60% | Emotional trigger, story, pattern interrupt. NO product mention. |
| 2\. Problem Aware | Know the problem, not solutions | \~20% | Mirror their pain. Agitate. Introduce possibility of resolution. |
| 3\. Solution Aware | Know solutions exist, comparing approaches | \~10% | Position your mechanism as superior. Case studies. Social proof. |
| 4\. Product Aware | Know your product, comparing to competitors | \~6% | Differentiate. Testimonials. Demonstrations. Overcome objections. |
| 5\. Most Aware | Know your product, ready to buy, waiting for deal | \~4% | Lead with offer. Urgency. Scarcity. Minimal copy needed. |

| BEN’S TARGETING ADVICE: If you’re starting from scratch with no brand, focus on Problem Aware, Solution Aware, and Product Aware. The Unaware market (60%) is the biggest opportunity but requires advanced creative skills. The Most Aware market (4%) requires an established brand. Start in the middle three. |
| :---- |

## **The 5 Stages of Market Sophistication (Schwartz / Ecomelite)**

Sophistication determines WHAT you say in your ad — whether you lead with a claim, a mechanism, or an identity.

| Stage | Market State | Your Strategy | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1\. Virgin | First product of its kind | Simple direct claim | "Lose weight" (first diet pill ever) |
| 2\. Enlarged Claims | Competitors appear, still believing | Bigger, more specific claims | "Lose 10lbs in 10 days" |
| 3\. Mechanism | Claims fatigued, skepticism rising | Introduce HOW it works differently | "The Japanese enzyme that melts fat while you sleep" |
| 4\. Enhanced Mechanism | Mechanisms known, need improvement | Make mechanism faster/easier/better | "Now 3X more potent — works for anyone over 40" |
| 5\. Identity | Total ad blindness, trust no one | Sell the person, not the product | "How Jennifer, mom of 3, finally lost the baby weight" |

| CRITICAL: Sophistication ≠ Awareness. Awareness \= do they know the problem? Sophistication \= how many solutions have they already seen? You must assess BOTH independently for every market you enter. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 3: Product Selection**

## **Match Product to Mechanism**

Your product must be the logical conclusion of the belief chain you build in your ad. This is the core principle from both the RMBC Method and Ben’s framework.

### **The UMP/UMS Framework (RMBC Method)**

**UMP (Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem):** The hidden, simple, counterintuitive reason the problem exists. This is "the knife in the hand." It explains WHY everything else they’ve tried has failed.

**UMS (Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution):** The one-sentence fix. "Take the knife out." Your product must embody this mechanism.

| Product-Market-Mechanism Fit: If the UMP is the root cause AND the UMS is the logical fix AND your product delivers the UMS — the sale is inevitable. The prospect walks themselves into buying. |
| :---- |

### **Product Selection Checklist**

* **Does the product solve the root cause (UMP)?** Not just mask symptoms — actually address the mechanism.

* **Can it be explained simply?** If you can’t explain HOW it works in one sentence, it’s too complicated.

* **Is it consumable/replenishable?** Subscription revenue makes scaling dramatically easier. Not mandatory, but a huge advantage.

* **Can it be sourced cheaply?** Target 3-5x markup minimum. Small, lightweight products reduce shipping costs.

* **Does it support multiple angles?** Can you sell it through different root causes to different segments?

* **Are competitors already selling it profitably?** Competition \= validated demand. No competition \= no market.

### **Supplier Communication**

Contact 3-5 suppliers (AliExpress, CJ Dropshipping, or private agents). Ask:

* Average processing time and shipping speed to your target country

* Blind dropshipping (no supplier branding on package)

* US/EU warehouse options for faster delivery

* Custom packaging or branded inserts

* Bulk pricing tiers and sample availability

* Return/defect policy

# **PHASE 4: Store Build**

## **Simple. Trust-First. Conversion-Focused.**

Your store has one job: convert the traffic your ads send. That’s it. Don’t over-design. Don’t over-feature. Ben sends traffic straight to a product page with a basic offer and it works because the AD did the selling.

### **Shopify Setup Essentials**

| Element | What To Do | Why It Matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Theme | Dawn (free) or Sense. Clean, fast, mobile-first. | Speed \= conversions. Fancy themes slow load times. |
| Product Page | Hero image \+ benefit headline \+ 5-8 images \+ benefit-driven description \+ reviews \+ trust badges | This is where 80% of purchases happen. Optimize here first. |
| Offer | Use proven offers: Buy 2 Get 1 Free, Free Gifts, or Subscribe & Save 20% | Increases AOV and gives a reason to buy NOW. |
| Trust Signals | Money-back guarantee badge, secure checkout, shipping policy, real reviews | Reduces friction for first-time buyers from cold ad traffic. |
| Essential Pages | About Us (brand story), Contact, Shipping, Returns, Privacy, Terms | Legal compliance \+ builds trust. |
| Essential Apps | Reviews (Judge.me), Upsells (AfterSell/ReConvert), Email (Shopify Email or Klaviyo) | Reviews build social proof. Upsells increase AOV. Email captures repeat revenue. |

### **The 90/10 Rule for Product Pages**

| 90% of your product page copy should focus on the FUNCTIONAL product (what it DOES — the transformation). 10% should validate with the PHYSICAL product (what it IS — materials, specs). Lead with dreams, support with features. Sell the destination, not the airplane. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 5: Ad Architecture**

## **The Static Ad Blueprint (VSSL-to-Text)**

Ben’s VSSL (Video Sales Letter) blueprint is the gold standard for direct response ads. For static ads, the same architecture applies — the image stops the scroll, the primary text does the selling.

### **The Creative Formula**

**Creative \= Angle \+ Concept \+ Format**

**Angle:** WHICH root cause you’re targeting. Same product, same desire, different entry story. (e.g., performance anxiety vs. bad habits vs. aging)

**Concept:** The BLUEPRINT of the ad — the structural formula. WHY the ad works. (e.g., personal discovery story, authority expose, symptom stacking)

**Format:** WHAT the ad looks like visually. (e.g., static image, mini VSSL, UGC testimonial, AI podcast, native ad)

### **Static Ad Structure (10 Sections)**

Each section maps to a part of Ben’s VSSL. Your primary text follows this chain:

| \# | Section | Lines | What It Does |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| A | HOOK (Micro Lead) | 1-2 | Stops the scroll. Must be visible BEFORE “See more.” Pattern interrupt or bold claim. |
| B | LEAD (Emotional Stakes) | 3-5 | Fear, empathy, or authority. Creates urgency to keep reading. |
| C | UMP (Root Cause) | 4-6 | Simple explanation of WHY the problem exists. Use analogy. No jargon. A child could understand. |
| D | DEBUNK (Existing Solutions) | 2-4 | Why common solutions fail. Respect existing beliefs — don’t attack, reframe. |
| E | UMS (Solution Mechanism) | 2-3 | ONE sentence: the simple fix. “Fix X and everything else fixes itself.” |
| F | PRODUCT REVEAL | 3-5 | Introduce product \+ handle top 2-3 objections from market research. |
| G | TRANSFORMATION | 3-4 | Timeline: Week 1, Week 2, Month 1\. Sell the outcome, not the product. |
| H | SOCIAL PROOF | 1-2 | Testimonial quote \+ number of customers. Use market language. |
| I | CTA \+ OFFER | 2-3 | Specific offer \+ justified urgency \+ clear instruction. |
| J | HEADLINE (below image) | 1 | Benefit-driven. Short. Under 10 words. |

### **Hook Formulas (Section A)**

Choose one. These are proven patterns:

* **Shocking Stat:** "\[X%\] of \[TARGET GROUP\] don’t realize \[HIDDEN PROBLEM\]. Here’s what \[AUTHORITY\] finally revealed:"

* **Pattern Interrupt:** "If you’re \[AGE/DEMO\] and still \[COMMON WRONG BEHAVIOR\], you need to see this."

* **Personal Discovery:** "My \[FAMILY MEMBER\] struggled with \[PROBLEM\] for \[X\] years. Then \[AUTHORITY\] explained what was really going on:"

* **Counterintuitive Claim:** "The \[COMMON SOLUTION\] you trust might actually be making your \[PROBLEM\] worse. Here’s why:"

* **Found Headline:** Use a high-engagement Reddit/forum headline verbatim (Schwartz: “copy is assembled, not written”).

### **The Image**

Your image does ONE job: stop the scroll. It doesn’t sell. The text sells.

* Lifestyle shot of target customer USING the product and looking relieved/happy/transformed

* Before/after split (left: pain, right: smiling/active)

* Product in-use with ONE short text overlay (max 5-7 words)

* Close-up of mechanism at work

* 1080x1080 or 1080x1350 (vertical takes more screen space on mobile)

* Keep text on image under 20% of total area

### **Belief Building in Your Ad (The 4 Methods)**

From the Changing Beliefs framework — weave these into sections C through G:

* **The ‘Yes’ Train:** Start with questions they MUST answer yes to. Build agreement momentum before introducing your mechanism.

* **Symptom Stacking:** Detail their exact experience with hyper-specific symptoms. Shared problems \= trusted solutions.

* **Authority Disruption:** "Forget everything you’ve heard about \[TOPIC\]" \+ strong authority credentials. Loosen old beliefs to install new ones.

* **Logical Proof Sequence:** Each statement leads naturally to the next using “because,” “therefore,” “which is why.” Reader proves to themselves it works.

| CARDINAL RULE OF BELIEF: One strong, specific, measurable claim beats ten weak ones. "Clinically proven to improve deep sleep by 47% in 14 days" \> a list of 12 benefits. The more you claim, the less they believe. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 6: Meta Ads Testing**

## **CBO Structure & Decision Rules**

Follow this exact structure. One campaign. Let Facebook’s algorithm find the winners.

### **Campaign Setup**

**1 CBO Campaign | Target Country Only | $50-100/day | Broad Targeting (Age \+ Gender only)**

### **Phase 6A: Desire Testing (Week 1\)**

5 ad sets inside the CBO. Each ad set targets a different DESIRE.

*Example for a sleep supplement:*

1. **Ad Set 1:** "I want to fall asleep faster" (Speed desire)

2. **Ad Set 2:** "I want to wake up with energy" (Energy desire)

3. **Ad Set 3:** "I want to stop relying on pills" (Independence desire)

4. **Ad Set 4:** "I want to protect my brain health" (Fear/prevention desire)

5. **Ad Set 5:** "I want to feel like myself again" (Identity/nostalgia desire)

Each ad set: 3-5 ad variations (same desire, different hooks or images).

### **Phase 6B: Angle Testing (Week 2-3)**

Once you find the winning desire (the ad set getting the most CBO spend), create a NEW campaign testing 5 different ANGLES within that desire.

*Example: winning desire is "I want to fall asleep faster":*

1. **Ad Set 1:** Stress/anxiety angle (root cause \= cortisol imbalance from chronic stress)

2. **Ad Set 2:** Screen time angle (root cause \= blue light destroying melatonin production)

3. **Ad Set 3:** Aging angle (root cause \= natural melatonin decline after 40\)

4. **Ad Set 4:** Diet angle (root cause \= gut-brain connection from processed food)

5. **Ad Set 5:** Medication angle (root cause \= dependency from years of sleep aids)

### **Decision Rules**

| Metric | Target | If Below Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CTR (Link) | \~5% | Weak hook. Rewrite Section A. |
| CPC (Link) | Under $1.50 | Weak targeting or weak creative. Test new angle. |
| ROAS | \> 2.0 | Increase budget 20%. If \> 4.0, increase 50%. |
| Winning Ad Set | Gets most CBO spend | THIS is your dominant desire/angle. Kill the rest. |
| No winners after 5 days | All ad sets unprofitable | Problem is upstream: wrong product, wrong market, or wrong desire. |

| BEN’S RULE: "All of ecom is ads. That’s literally all that matters." Keep making new ads. Each failure teaches you something. Winners emerge from volume. The guaranteed path to millions is to keep testing, keep learning, keep iterating. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 7: Post-Purchase Revenue**

## **The Diamond Upsell Flow**

From the D2C Post-Purchase Upsell Research: the post-purchase window is a unique economic environment where the risk of rejection is zero (you already have the sale) and the reward of aggression is amplified (buying momentum \+ dopamine loop).

### **The Diamond Flow Architecture**

**Step 1: Customer completes checkout →**

**Step 2: Offer 1 — THE ANCHOR (Bundle/Upgrade)**

* High-ticket: 2-3x core product price

* Frame as upgrade, not addition: "Complete the system for just $X more (Bundle value $Y)"

* Psychology: Capture the "whales" (price-insensitive top 10-20%)

**Step 3: Conditional Split →**

* **If ACCEPTED → Offer 2 (Cross-Sell):** Low-ticket accessory or digital product. "Fries with that." Customer is in euphoric yes-loop.

* **If DECLINED → Offer 2 (Downsell):** Single component of the bundle or low-ticket accessory. Contrast effect makes it feel cheap after seeing the bundle price.

| Metric | Average | Good | Excellent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Upsell Take Rate | 3-5% | 7-10% | 15%+ |
| AOV Lift | 5% | 10% | 20%+ |
| Downsell Conversion | 2-4% | 5-8% | 12%+ |

| THE MATH THAT MATTERS: 1,000 customers × $20 upsell × 20% CVR \= $4,000. Same 1,000 customers × $100 bundle × 6% CVR \= $6,000. Lower conversion, 50% more revenue. Always lead with the high-ticket offer first. |
| :---- |

# **PHASE 8: Scale & Iterate**

## **From 1K to 10K to 100K Days**

### **0 → $1K/day (Hardest)**

* Find ONE winning ad that’s profitable

* Run to product page with proven offer (Buy 2 Get 1, Free Gift, etc.)

* Focus entirely on making ads that convert

* Test 5 desires, find winner, test 5 angles within winner

### **$1K → $10K/day**

* Scale winning ad sets: increase budget 20% every 2-3 days if ROAS holds

* Create 10-20 variations of your winning concept (new hooks, new images, same structure)

* Add new angles to campaign

* Implement post-purchase upsell flow (Diamond Flow)

* Start email flows: post-purchase thank you → review request (day 7\) → repurchase (day 21\)

* Consider listicle/advertorial landing pages alongside product page

### **$10K → $100K/day**

* Multiple winning creatives running simultaneously (5-10+ profitable ads)

* New batch of creatives every week

* Expand to Unaware market (harder creative, bigger audience)

* Expand to new platforms (TikTok, YouTube)

* Build subscription revenue for predictable baseline

* Optimize LTV: email/SMS flows, loyalty program, new product launches for existing customers

* Brand building: identity marketing (Stage 5 sophistication)

| The difference between a $1K day and a $30K day isn’t the product — it’s the desire you tap into, the mechanism you reveal, and the volume of creatives you produce. Master the framework. Execute relentlessly. The market is already telling you what it wants. |
| :---- |

# **Appendix A: Framework Quick Reference**

| Term | Definition |
| :---- | :---- |
| Mass Desire | Pre-existing wants in the market. Not created, found and channeled onto your product. |
| UMP | Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem. The hidden root cause. "The knife in the hand." |
| UMS | Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution. The one-sentence fix. "Take the knife out." |
| Angle | Which root cause you target. Same product, different entry story. Each angle \= separate ad set. |
| Concept | The structural blueprint of the ad. The formula behind WHY it works. |
| Format | What the ad looks like: static image, VSSL, UGC, native, etc. |
| Micro Lead | First 1-2 lines. Stops the scroll. Must be visible before “See more.” |
| Lead | Lines 3-5. Creates emotional stakes after they click “See more.” |
| Gradualization | Shifting beliefs gradually through a chain of accepted truths. Never violate existing beliefs head-on. |
| Intensification | Taking a core idea and reinforcing it with increasing specificity and emotional weight. |
| Identification | Marketing that shows WHO the customer becomes by buying. Identity \> features at Stage 5\. |
| Redefinition | Reframing objections (too complex, too unimportant, too expensive) before the prospect raises them. |
| Mechanization | Naming, describing, and featuring the specific mechanism that makes your product work. |
| Concentration | Contrasting competitor weaknesses point-by-point with your strengths. |
| The Diamond Flow | Post-purchase upsell: High-Ticket Anchor first → Downsell if declined → Cross-sell if accepted. |
| CBO | Campaign Budget Optimization. Facebook allocates budget to best-performing ad sets automatically. |
| ROAS | Return on Ad Spend. Revenue ÷ Ad Spend. Target \> 2.0 minimum for scaling. |
| LTV / CLV | Lifetime Value. Total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship. Determines max CAC. |
